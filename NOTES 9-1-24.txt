POUR PAINT IDEA - IT might be possible to replicate the Red Wings logo in a cool wayt using a pour paint technique. Use a diffuser to create the wheel pattern and try to replicate the wing with some other pour or scrape technique/
	- silver or ir white background, use tape to mask edges of wings. will need to get right the timing of unmasking because it could rip us layers of paint if allowed to dry too much.
	- may want to pull tape while paint is still quite dry sand continuie the pour of even scrape the remaining wet paint
